# bernoully

This is the source code for the Bernoully extension. It automatically logs in to [Meu Bernoulli](https://meu.bernoulli.com.br)

### Configuration

Simply open [developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) and enter the following:
```js
window.localStorage.setItem('BERNOULLY_USER', 'YOUR-USERNAME-HERE');
window.localStorage.setItem('BERNOULLY_PASSWORD', 'YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE');
```

that's it! You're, now, up and running. Everytime you open [Meu Bernoulli](https://meu.bernoulli.com.br), the extension will fill the login information automatically.
